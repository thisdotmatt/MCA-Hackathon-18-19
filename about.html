  <h1> What is the best way to learn? </h1>
  <p> The best way to learn is to ask about your problems. Students are often hesitant when asking their teachers for help in front of a class 
due to fear of being rejected or because their teachers are incompetant. Now with Studently, students can ask others students for help. These 
    students can now help each other learn because the best teachers are fellow students.</p>
  <h1> Our Task Manager </h1>
  <p> Our simplistic task manager allows you to see what tasks you need to complete in an easy to see way. We don't have the fancy bells and whistles that other website
    may have, but we are simplistic in our design and this minimalistic approach allows us to ensure you aren't overwhelmed by features.</p>
