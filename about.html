  <h1> What is the best way to learn? </h1>
  <p> The best way to learn is to ask about your problems. Students are often hesitant when asking their teachers for help in front of a class 
due to fear of being rejected or because their teachers are incompetant. Now with Studently, students can ask others students for help. These 
    students can now help each other learn because the best teachers are fellow students.</p>
